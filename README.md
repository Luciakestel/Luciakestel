### Hello world ğŸ‘‹


My name is LucÃ­a, and I'm a chemical engineering graduate who wants to risk everything and turn her life around. I signed up for a web programming Bootcamp, an intensive three-month course that changes your life. Now, reinvented and proud, I can say that I am a junior front-end developer looking for an opportunity where I can give my best and show what I am capable of. ğŸ’«ğŸš€
